You can find several entertaining posts there, and I have gathered the most popular posts in a separate <a href="https://success-is-no-accident.blogspot.com/"> blog</a>.<br/> There is a pretty useful <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexander-parshakov_ai-activity-7183927762083008513-cRpD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop">post</a> which can help find keywords for <a href="index.html#SEO" target="_blank">SEO</a> using just the search engine - and absolutely free of charge:<br/><em> As I enter my query into the search box, I pay close attention to the suggestions it provides. For example, if I'm interested in learning (more) about B2B Marketing, I quickly receive suggestions such as: b2b marketing itself and also b2b marketing expo/ awards/ meaning/ strategy/ agency…</em> - these are exactly the keywords, often the much desired long-tail keywords!<br/>Other sections (on the first page of the search results) which help to identify the keywords people actually use in their searches include: “Related searches” and "People also ask"</p>
